Based on a survey from KIC, 30%-60% Indonesian affected by hoaxes when talking about
the internet. One of the most popular forms of hoax is deep fake. Our team is wondering how to
educate Indonesian about deepfake awareness to avoid false statements and how to train models
with machine learning to provide accurate results providing whether a data is deep fake or not.
Why? Because in the last 5 year in Indonesia there have been several unique dramas, and the
problem is hoax, but most Indonesian believe it because they only look by the title and
photos/videos. Our team tends to create application that will be the platform to check whether the
content (videos) is deep fake or not.
